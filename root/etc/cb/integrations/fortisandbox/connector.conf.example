; binary_filter_query

binary_filter_query=is_executable_image:true -(digsig_publisher:"Microsoft Corporation" and digsig_result:"Signed")

; Concurrency settings
;
; The following two parameters control how many concurrent queries will be
; performed against the fortisandbox server. The "quick_scan_threads" setting
; specifies how many threads will be querying the fortisandbox appliance via
; file hash at once. The "deep_scan_threads" setting specifies how many
; full file scans can be actively "in flight" at a given time. The default
; is that three files can be analyzed in parallel at any given time.
;
; ***WARNING***
;
; By setting fortisandbox_deep_scan_threads to GREATER THAN zero and submit_full_binaries to 1, you will be submitting
; FULL binaries to FortiSandbox for analysis.  This is different from fortisandbox_quick_scan_threads which ONLY submit the
; HASH to Virus Total.
